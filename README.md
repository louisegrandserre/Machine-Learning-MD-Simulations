# MD simulation techniques

This repository contains scripts and codes developed during my internship in Prof. Kirk H. Bevan's group at McGill University for various molecular dynamics (MD) techniques, including VASP, LAMMPS, MACE-MP-0, and DeePMD.

## Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific machine learning MD technique:

- `VASP/`: Scripts and input files related to simulations using VASP.
- `LAMMPS/`: Code snippets and parameter files for LAMMPS simulations.
- `DeePMD/`: Implementations and examples using DeePMD for machine learning MD simulations.
- `MACE/`: Scripts and notebooks for utilizing MACE-MP-0 (Machine Learning Atomic Cluster Expansion).

I have worked on Radial Distribution Functions (RDF) and phonon modes, so each section will include a dedicated folder for these calculations.

## Usage

Feel free to explore each directory for detailed instructions on running simulations and analyzing results specific to each machine learning MD technique.
